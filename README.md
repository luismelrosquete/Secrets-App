# Secrets App
Allow users to anonymously submit their secrets for other people to see them. At the moment, users can only submit one secret and they will all be rendered into a secrets page for all users to see. 

I used NodeJS, ExpressJS, and EJS to build this app. I also used packages like Passport to handle the authentication functionality of the app. 

## What's Coming Next For This App?

The next releases of this secrets app will have the following:

- An option for users to submit more than one secret
- An option to sign in with Facebook
- An option to see all secrets of the logged in user in one page
